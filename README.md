This is a breed-list-api. The idea behind this was when a person is considerin buying a dog they should do research on different dog breeds to see how big they will get as well as their different requirenmtents. So this list is were they can store their ideas so far. Somthing like their 'considering' list. This app is supposed to help keep track of the potential dog breeds a user is thinking of gettting. To add to the list you need to add breed, gender, weight, height. The user is also able to modify a list item and add new ones as well as delete one they don't want on their list anymore.

User stories

As a user I would like to be able to add things to the list
As a user I would like to be able to see the full list
As a user I would like to see individual items in the list
As a user I would like to be able to update list items
As a user I would like to remove items from the list

Challenges:

One of this challenges I had was trying to figure out what the current_user would do. I wasn't sure at first what it did and why it was importatnt to put it in. As I continued with the project it started to make more sense. This current_user was exactly what it said. It was keeping track of who was the current person logged in. This would help with having different items in the list for each user. So if user 1 added two items and user 2 logged in they wouldn't be able to see user 1's items.

Technologies used:

For the back end I used Ruby and Ruby on rails.

Unsolved 'problems':

The only part i would have liked to so is add another resource and link it to my exsisting one. This would have made the project a bit more than what it is. I would have liked to add a table for pets that are avaliable for adoption and link it to what the user was looking for. For example if they wanted a husky and there was a husky for adoption, it would show that to the user
